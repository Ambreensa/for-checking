        Software is any set of instructions that tells the hardware what to do and how to do it. </p>
        <h4 style="background-color: beige;">What are the different types of computers</h4>
        <p>When most people hear the word computer, they think of a personal computer such as a desktop or laptop.</p>
        <h5 style="background-color: antiquewhite;">Desktop computers</h5>
        <p>Many people use desktop computers at work, home, and school. Desktop computers are designed to be placed on a desk, and they're typically made up of a few different parts, including the computer case, monitor, keyboard, and mouse.</p>
<h6 style="background-color: aquamarine;""><strong>Laptop computers</strong></h6>
<p><br><strong>The second type of computer you may be familiar with is a laptop computer, commonly called a laptop. Laptops are battery-powered computers that are more portable than desktops, allowing you to use them almost anywhere</strong>
